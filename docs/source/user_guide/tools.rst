A successful tracking session can be opened and processed with our extra tools.

- :ref:`validator`. Correct and validate your session's trajectories. Navigate though the errors in the video, interpolate the *NaN* gaps, edit the identity labels, define identity groups, mark setup points and explore the details of the session.
- :ref:`video generators`. Create mixed videos with the tracked trajectories on top of your original videos. Create also individual videos to feed posture estimator softwares.
- :ref:`idmatcher.ai`. Match identities between different tracking sessions with the same animals (under construction).
- :ref:`data analysis`. Simple trajectory analyzer and some of our analysis examples.
